# Hi, I’m **Junzhe Chen**. 

I am also known as chén jǜn-zhé (Romanised Chinese) or JC (Initials)

I do Analog IC related research at University of Bristol. I graduated from UCL BEng Electronics and Electrical Engineering with First Class Honours (Rank 5/173). I served as the President and Head of Projects at [**UCL Fleming Society**](https://github.com/Fleming-Society).

I worked as Analog IC designer at [**IntrinSic Semiconductors**](https://www.intrinsicsemi.com/) and [**Cirrus Logic**](https://www.cirrus.com/). I have worked on _TSMC 180BCD_, _TSMC 55nm_, and _Global Foundry 12nm FinFET_. Sometimes, I do some HiFi speaker and amplifier projects with [**Audio First Design**](https://audiofirstdesigns.co.uk/). 

I am looking for funded PhD research on Analog / Mixed-signal Integrated Circuit design in UK/EU/US
