Hi, I’m Junzhe Chen. I can also known as chén jǜn-zhé (Romanised Chinese) or JC (Initials)

I graduated from UCL BEng Electronics and Electrical Engineering with First Class Honours (Rank 5/173). I served as the President and Head of Projects at [UCL Fleming Society](https://github.com/Fleming-Society).

I am currently an Analog Circuit designer. I have worked on TSMC 55nm and Global Foundry 12nm FinFET. Sometimes, I do some HiFi speaker and amplifier project with [Audio First Design](https://audiofirstdesigns.co.uk/). At the same time, I am looking for funded PhD research on Analog / Mixed-signal Integrated Circuit design

Some of my projects (updates coming soon!)
- [Fully Discrete Analog PWM Modulator with Adjustable Frequency](https://github.com/Junzhe-Chen/PWM-Modulator-Circuit)
  - [MATLAB PWM Modulator](https://github.com/Junzhe-Chen/PWM-modulator-demo)
- [Breadboard size obstacle avoiding drone](https://github.com/Junzhe-Chen/Two-wheels-breadboard-drone)
- [TPA3116-based Class D Audio Amplifier](https://oshwlab.com/jc040226/tpa3116-amplifier)
- Cross Bias Referenced Class G Amplifier
- MATLAB Instrument Control Program that reads and analyse data directly from the scope
